Working through a basic problem in the ISLM model:
   here is a basic solution to a problem involving the ISLM model.
   here I set a (the amount consumed if disposable income were zero), to 35
   b - them marginal propensity to consume - is .5
   Tax rate is .1
   I0 - the investments if interest rate was zero - is 30
   h - the decrease in investment demand for increase in interest rate - is 200
   k - the sensity to money demand in relation to gdp - is 1.25.
   mu - the decrease (fractional) of money demand in relation to interest rate - is 2
   MS - the money supply - is 100
   this is a very over simplified model obviously. A few issues with it include:
   1) it doesn't take into account the supply side
   2) investment demand should itself be a function of gdp
   3) it doesnt' take into account labor - people should be willing to work more if less is taxed
   4) it doesn't take into account supply side of investments - people should be put more income
      into investments if interest rate is higher
   Thus we see that the ISLM model is fairly simple.
   In my view, the most important true principal of the model is that interest rate is not
   arbitrary and is (or usually is), determined by the market reaching equilibrium
   To better understand the model, I reccomend looking at the equations in ISLM.py

Solution:
   money demand is: 100.0
   interest rate is: 0.1
   GDP is: 100.0
   Government spending is: 10.0
   disposable income is: 90.0
   Consumption is: 80.0
   Investments are: 10.0

Effect of tax rate on gdp:
   tax rate: 0.0% GDP: 96.24
   tax rate: 20.0% GDP: 104.28
   tax rate: 40.0% GDP: 115.07
   tax rate: 60.0% GDP: 130.8
   tax rate: 80.0% GDP: 157.6
   GDP increases with increased taxes, because government spending is counted
   as part of GDP. Discounting government spending, investment and consumption
   decline with increased Gov't spending. It's important that this is just a
   an overly simplified model.

Effect of tax rate on Consumption:
   tax rate: 0.0% Consumption: 83.12
   tax rate: 20.0% Consumption: 76.71
   tax rate: 40.0% Consumption: 69.52
   tax rate: 60.0% Consumption: 61.16
   tax rate: 80.0% Consumption: 50.76
   as we see, with higher taxes, consumption decreases.

Algebraic solution to the model:
   it turns out that solving this algebraicly would be very difficult
   here is the algebraic solution for GDP:
    (I0*k*mu + a*k*mu - h*k + sqrt(k*(I0**2*k*mu**2 + 2*I0*a*k*mu**2 - 2*I0*h*k*mu + 4*Ms*Tr*b*h*mu - 4*Ms*Tr*h*mu - 4*Ms*b*h*mu + 4*Ms*h*mu + a**2*k*mu**2 - 2*a*h*k*mu + h**2*k)))/(2*k*mu*(Tr*b - Tr - b + 1))
   and here is the algebraic solution for consumption:
    (-I0*b*k*mu + a*b*k*mu - 2*a*k*mu + b*h*k - b*sqrt(k*(I0**2*k*mu**2 + 2*I0*a*k*mu**2 - 2*I0*h*k*mu + 4*Ms*Tr*b*h*mu - 4*Ms*Tr*h*mu - 4*Ms*b*h*mu + 4*Ms*h*mu + a**2*k*mu**2 - 2*a*h*k*mu + h**2*k)))/(2*k*mu*(b - 1))
